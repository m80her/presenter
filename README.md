# presenter
Proof of concept recreating a PowerPoint presentation in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

Brand were getting uncomfortable that there were what seemed like 9000+ hacked together PowerPoint presentations saved on individual laptops throughout the organisation that at best partially respresented the company branding.

> What if... we had a webapp solution for creating presentations that could be globally updated and still allow users to add in custom slides via a templating system?

My task was to build a proof of concept presentation webapp that improved on the animations of the company PowerPoint presentation.

Fixed size and responsive examples were created, and delivered ready to be implemented into a backend system that would allow users to clone and edit presentations based on their location and specific requirements.
